# Hallita

---

This is a bot I've been wanting to make for a long time.  
It's a bit advanced, and will take some time to finish.

I want it to have all the things my [old bot](https://github.com/qanazoga/soturi) had, plus a bunch of new features.

### New things:
- Using Discord's OAuth system, guild owners should be able to configure Hallita's settings for their guild. This idea/module will be known as The Hub going forward.
- My old bot's role signup system was neat, but it required manual binding of roles and message id's in it's (badly managed) JSON files. With Hallita, we should have both a command for this, and allow it to be configured in The Hub.
- The same is true for any modules, guild owners should be able to designate a Text Channel as the one that will be used for modules (if the module requires one and they want it turned on). They should be able to do this through either commands or The Hub
- Guild owners should be able to turn commands on and off for their guild, through either commands or The Hub.
- The Librarian Module should also be able to be set up via commands or The Hub for any channel. It should be able to be configured to remove or allow posts for a variety of reasons (has/doesn't have link/image/file, explicit language, etc). 
- All the MFW pictures should be viewable on The Hub. MFW pictures should also be able to be upvoted and downvoted and store record of this, which will also be viewable (to help us keep weed out the worse ones).
